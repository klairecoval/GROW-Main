# GROW
Grow is both a digital and physical interactive experience that encourages participants to foster positive thoughts of their own and find common ground with others.  It will showcase how community and positive thinking can light up the whole world.

### Development
- first time: `npm i` (obviously)
- lint code: `npm test`
- build client code: `npm run build`
- build just react: `npm run buildAppBundle`
- build just css from scss: `npm run buildSass`
- run: `npm start`
*note: nodemon is also installed. check package.json for setup.*

### Contributing to Code
- Contact Claire to be approved for repo
- **Do not merge PR before review**
- `npm test` before committing
- Do not work on master unless otherwise approved
- Use a spell checker if needed

### General Git Commands and Workflow
- `git checkout master`
- `git pull`
- `git checkout -b [new branch name]`
- (make changes to code)
- `npm test`
- (resolve issues)
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "[commit message here]`
- `git push` to submit a PR
- `git checkout master` to get back to master branch. *Do not forget this step to avoid nesting branches and messing everything up*
